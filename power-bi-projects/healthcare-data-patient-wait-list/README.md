# Healthcare Data - Patient Wait List Dashboard
This project is a Power BI portfolio project showcasing healthcare-related data visualization and reporting.
It demonstrates my ability to clean, transform, and analyze data, as well as design clear and insightful dashboards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Skills Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Data Modeling
- DAX for calculated columns and measures
- Data Cleaning & Transformation with Power Query
- Interactive Dashboards (filters, slicers, drill-throughs)

## üìä Datasets
- The datasets used in this project contain real, publicly available healthcare data (non-sensitive, anonymized).
- The data analyzed covers the years **2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021**.
- The datasets are located in the **Inpatient** and **Outpatient** folders respectively.
- The data is **divided into two tables per year** depending on the patient case type ‚Äî **Inpatient** or **Outpatient**.
- **Inpatient**: A patient that stays in a hospital while under treatment.
- **Outpatient**: A patient who receives medical treatment without being admitted to the hospital.
- **Day Case**: Also analyzed in the project. This is an Inpatient case that stayed in a hospital for treatment for only one day.
- For the four years, there are **eight CSV files in total**, which are merged into the **‚ÄúAll_Data‚Äù** table later in the project.
- There is also a **Mapping_Specialty.csv**, which is used for mapping the **Specialty** in the **‚ÄúAll_Data‚Äù** table with **the Specialty Group** in the **Mapping_Specialty.csv**.
