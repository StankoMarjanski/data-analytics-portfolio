# Healthcare Data - Patient Wait List Dashboard
This project is a Power BI portfolio project showcasing healthcare-related data visualization and reporting.
It demonstrates my ability to clean, transform, and analyze data, as well as design clear and insightful dashboards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Skills Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Data Modeling
- DAX for calculated columns and measures
- Data Cleaning & Transformation with Power Query
- Interactive Dashboards (filters, slicers, drill-throughs)

## üìä Datasets
- The datasets used in this project contain real publicly available healthcare data (non-sensitive, anonymized).
- The data analyzed is from the years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021.
- The datasets are located in the Inpatient and Outpatient folders respectivaly.
- The data is devided into 2 tables per year depending on the case type of patient - Inpatient or Outpatient.
- Inpatient - a patient that stays in a hospital while under treatment .
- Outpatient - a patient who receives medical treatment without being admitted to the hospital.
- Day Case type is also analyzed in the project, it is an Inpatient case that had stayed in a hospital for tratment for only one day
- So for the 4 years there 8 csv files in total, which are merged into "All_Data" table later in the project.
- There is also a Maping_Specialty.csv which is used for mapping the Specialty in the "All_Data" table with the Speacialty Group in the Maping_Specialty.csv.
